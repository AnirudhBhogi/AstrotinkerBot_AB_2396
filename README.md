he robot's brain is powered by an FPGA that reads and processes the sensor data and controls the actuators. This project includes building the robot from scratch using an FPGA, implementing single-cycle RISC-V CPU design, and creating a hardware-software co-design using Verilog HDL to unveil the powerful parallel processing capabilities of FPGAs.

In a future not too distant, the boundaries of human exploration will extend far beyond our home planet. Space exploration and colonization have become remarkable feats of human achievement, with space stations serving as the key outposts for these endeavors. So, regular check-ups, system upgrades, and troubleshooting have become paramount to maintaining the delicate balance between human survival and scientific progress.

Recognizing the need for efficient and reliable solutions, This theme revolves around a scenario where a robot is dispatched to a space station, divided into different modules, to rectify any problems that arise. Prompted by wireless alerts from the central hub, the robot navigates through the modules, swiftly locating faulty or missing components. It then communicates the issue to the central hub before heading to the electronics warehouse to perform the necessary repairs.

The core challenge of this theme lies in constructing the AstroTinker Bot from scratch, utilizing an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) as its powerhouse. Through the FPGA's adept control over sensors and actuators, the robot adeptly traverses the arena, perceives its environment, and drags essential components from the electronics warehouse. Wireless communication serves as the primary means for exchanging vital information with the central hub. By participating in this theme, teams are presented with the opportunity to create a sophisticated CPU architecture using Verilog HDL, unveiling the remarkable parallel processing capabilities offered by FPGAs.
