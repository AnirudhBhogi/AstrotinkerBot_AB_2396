he robot's brain is powered by an FPGA that reads and processes the sensor data and controls the actuators. This project includes building the robot from scratch using an FPGA, implementing single-cycle RISC-V CPU design, and creating a hardware-software co-design using Verilog HDL to unveil the powerful parallel processing capabilities of FPGAs.
